# Welcome to my Website :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses [React Material UI 5](https://mui.com/) Design Components.

I built and maintain this site to act as an online software portfolio and whatever else I decide to use it for in the future. It's hosted on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) using the Static Web App service, and my domain's handled by Google.

## Development

Want to use part of my React Code? Go ahead, and drop a star while you're at it 😄! Here's some npm scripts you'll need to know, provided by Create-React-App:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
